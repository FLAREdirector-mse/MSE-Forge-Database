Oracle:Prismatic â€” Whenever you cast a multicolored spell, if you cast it from your hand, look at the top four cards of your library. You may cast a multicolored card that's different colors and costs less from among them without paying its mana cost. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.\n
