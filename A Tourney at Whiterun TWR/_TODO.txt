TODO:
* Fabled cards (we may have to use a kicker cost)
* Infiltrate cards
* Cripple cards (right now the cards work but they all show up as Spectacle, which is not ideal)

* All blue cards alphabetically between 64 Pilgrim's Muse and 71 Territorial Drake
* All black cards except Knight of the Raven and reprints
* All red cards except Knight of the Hawk and reprints
* All green cards except Knight of the Verdigris and reprints
* All gold cards
* All hybrid cards
* Whiterun Harbor (currently all players draw a card simultaneously)
