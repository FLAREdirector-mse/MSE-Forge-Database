When you're naming your file, ignore apostrophes [ajanis_welcome.txt] and commas [sheoldred_whispering_one.txt], and replace all spaces with underscores _.\nMake comments in your files by prefacing them with ##.\nMost cards can be generated just by cobbling together parts from cards that already exist. Scryfall is your friend!\nWith complex cards, it is highly recommended that you test them yourself in Forge before uploading them here.
